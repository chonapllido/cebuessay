	<h4 class="process-title blue">Step by Step Process in Writing a Dissertation</h4>
	<p class="main-article">Writing dissertations involves two sets of process: 1) the writing process and 2) the action points.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title">1. Writing Process</h4>
	<p class="main-article">Before students should pursue their dissertation studies, they are advised to undergo the following stages:</p>
	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
		<li><strong>Brainstorming and contemplating</strong>
			<p>In this process, students should select a specific topic as well as think of a strong thesis statement. One of the key aspects in making a dissertation an academic success is the selection of the thesis statement. The thesis statement is the foundation of the entire research; the researcher will enjoy academic recognition should the dissertation succeeds in getting attention.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Preparation and selection of research materials</strong>
			<p>In this step, it is necessary for students to select their primary and secondary sources carefully to make sure that those sources are relevant. Relatively, they must also prepare their materials for their research. As research materials such as questionnaires and experiment results are the basis of the numerical data of your research, it is necessary to design and prepare them before hand to ensure that those would yield the desired result.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Conducting the research</strong>
			<p>This process includes the following:</p>
			<ul class="sub-list">
				<li>* gathering of data</li>
				<li>* conducting interviews</li>
				<li>* conducting internet research</li>
				<li>* taking down notes</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Putting oneâ€™s thoughts into writing</strong>
			<p>In this process, students will have to write their thoughts regarding the research and start to structure their dissertation in formal and academic form. In this stage, students need to demonstrate objective judgment as they have to analyze the gathered information without prejudice. Professionalism should, at all times, be practiced.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Sharing ideas with other researchers with similar fields of study.</strong>
			<p>The process of writing a dissertation is long and complex. Thus, in the course of the writing process, it is helpful to share ideas with other researchers, professors, and research experts to gain more insight on the chosen field of study.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Revision stage</strong>
			<p>Dissertation writing should aim for perfection in content. In the revision stage, students should be able to perfect the presentation of ideas including the usage of language and conciseness. Considering this goal, it is necessary to revise the paper several times to ensure that there are no loopholes in the content as well as in the technical aspect (layout, grammar errors, referencing). Additionally, in the revision stage, it is helpful to ask other people to review the paper. In this way, the researcher will get information regarding which part of the paper that needs correction or improvement.</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Proofreading and editing</strong>
			<p>In this process, students need to check the paper in the context of content and technicalities. In this case, the services of writing service companies come in handy as they provide assistance in editing and proofreading papers. </p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="process-title">2. Action Points</h4>
	<p class="main-article">As dissertations are passed to attain a degree (doctoral, masters, undergraduate), it is necessary to comply with time schedules to ensure that the writing process is organized. Action points refer to the procedures that students must undergo to attain the approval of their dissertation project. These include the passing of the necessary requirements to the advisor and department. Enumerated below are the common action points in writing dissertations:</p>
	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">

		<li>Submission of potential topics to advisor</li>
		<li>Tentative approval of the chosen topic (Advisor)</li>
		<li>Departmental approval of the elected advisor and topic</li>

		<li>Inclusion of the committee and advisor comments on the proposal</li>
		<li>Approval of the proposal</li>
		<li>Beginning of the dissertation study</li>
