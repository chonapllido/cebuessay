			<p>An essay is "any short piece of nonfiction: an editorial, a feature story, a critical study, even an excerpt from a book." (Source: About.com Grammar and Composition)</p>

	<p class="main-article">The above definition captures the bare essentials of every essay: its fact-based element and the diverse forms it is capable to take. Essay in its simplest is a literary exhaust, a capsule of momentary insights that plague us every once in a while or frequently, depending on the levels of heightened senses we experience. On the other hand, an essay serves as an academic medium through which mastery in communication, analysis, research and other fields are construed to form one reader-friendly piece. Among other prose or verse forms, an essay is considered readable for almost every type of reader. Its free flow renders the smooth incorporation of grammar rules but allows air for experimental and personal vocabulary musings every now and then. Moreover, an essay’s human touch enables the reader to empathize regardless of cultural, religious or social backgrounds.</p>
	<p class="main-article">In summary, an essay has two clear objectives: for the essayist to express and for the open reader to be entertained, inspired, or informed.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title blue">INTRODUCTION ON WRITING AN ESSAY</h4>
	<p class="main-article">Writing an essay requires the full channeling of the acquired skills of the essayist. This being said, an essay reflects the level of mastery or expertise the essayist has achieved. This strengthens the use of essays as means for quantifying the student’s understanding and ability to apply the insights of any material source or event to the immediate environment. In writing an essay, what could be more important, the exemplified skills or the ability to channel these skills? The instructor preferably wants to see both; however, the former is the most visible requirement specified among various course requirements.</p>
	<p class="main-article">The skills acquired by an essayist are relative indications of things that one has picked up prior, during or after a course session. Putting them in paper is simply showcasing these skills. However, fully extending them towards a single goal, such as in the form of an essay is not an easy process. Factors restrict our ability to actively do so -- a language barrier is one. In academic terms, language is the medium of an acceptable essay. This presents a major restriction for students who normally do not use this language medium when expressing themselves. Evidently, these students need assistance and a responsive service to name a few.</p>
