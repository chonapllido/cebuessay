	<p class="main-article">Term Papers are written outputs of intelligent and systematic research. The content of a term paper focuses on a specific subject. It discusses the issues, information, and previous researches related to the chosen subject. In schools, especially in institutions of higher education, students are required to make a term paper as it is one of the academic requirements. Term papers show where the students are heading into; and show how extensive a student’s knowledge is on a specific subject.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title blue">College Term Paper Term</h4>
	<p class="main-article">College term paper is necessary because it is one of the most critical academic requirements. In colleges and universities, students need to write term paper with proficiency as it is one of the bases whether they should have a passing or failing grade. Most, if not all, college professors require students to pass research papers to ensure that students are doing their job as students. As term papers are products of intelligent and systematic research, requiring students to make research papers is one of the ways in determining the student’s level of understanding. Some students think that making research papers is a tiring task. As every minute is precious, spending long hours making research papers is seemingly a total waste of time. However, the process in writing research papers is quite easy as there are standard procedures, which will guide students in writing papers. The process of writing college research papers includes the following:</p>
	<strong class="process-title">1. Choosing a subject</strong>

	<strong class="process-title">3. Analyzing the information gathered from the sources and making notes</strong>
	<p class="main-article">As research needs critical analysis, students need to analyze and understand the information thoroughly. Additionally, making notes is necessary as students may have problems in remembering the information gathered. In making notes, students need to record the pages, book title, and author to locate the information easily. Lastly, it is also beneficial to record the publication information of the sources as those will be needed in citing the sources within the paper.</p>
	<strong class="process-title">4. Outlining the paper</strong>
	<p class="main-article">Outlining the paper is like putting together the paper’s backbone; it is the process where students group similar information together. Basically, the paper’s outline consists of phrases and key words. Also, this process requires students to think of sub-topics that are closely related to the subject.</p>
	<strong class="process-title">5. Writing the draft</strong>
	<p class="main-article">In writing the draft, students should already have a clear purpose in writing the paper. In this process, students will say what they have to say about the subject in relation to the information they have gathered from the sources.</p>
	<strong class="process-title">6. Editing and Proofreading</strong>
	<p class="main-article">This is the last step of the writing process. In this process, students need to read their work several times to ensure that it is free from plagiarism and has no grammar errors. Additionally, it is necessary to check the content of the paper to ensure that it will pass the academic standards.</p>
	<p class="main-article">See! The writing procedures are quite easy; students need not be afraid that they should fail the subject if they will follow the steps and write their research papers with enthusiasm.</p>
