	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
		<li>Your thesis should make a claim with which it would be possible for readers to disagree. In other words, move beyond defending statements that your readers would accept as obviously true.</li>
		<li>Be skeptical of your first (often semiautomatic) response to a subject: it will often be a cliché (however unintentional). Avoid conventional wisdom unless you introduce a fresh perspective on it.</li>
		<li>Convert broad categories and generic (fits anything) claims to more specific assertions. Find ways to bring out the complexity of your subject.</li>
		<li>Submit the wording of your thesis to this grammatical test: if it follows the “abstract noun + is + evaluative adjective” formula (“The economic situation is bad”), substitute a more specific noun and an active verb that will force you to predicate something about a focused subject (“Tax laws benefit the rich”).</li>
		<li>Routinely examine and question your own key terms and categories rather than simply accepting them. Assume that they mean more than you first thought.</li>
		<li>Always work to uncover and make explicit the unstated assumptions (premises) underlying your thesis. Don’t treat debatable premises as givens.</li>
		<li>As a rule, be suspicious of thesis statements that depend on words such as <i>real</i>, <i>accurate</i>, <i>believable</i>, <i>right</i>, and <i>good</i>. These words usually signal that you are offering personal opinions—what “feels” right to you—as self-evident truths for everybody.</li>
		<li>One-way to assess the adequacy of a thesis statement is to ask yourself where the writer would need to go next to develop his or her idea. If you can’t answer that question, the thesis is still too weak.</li>
		<li>Qualify your claims; you will avoid the global pronouncements—typical of the dangers of overly categorical thinking—that are too broad to be of much use (or true).</li>
