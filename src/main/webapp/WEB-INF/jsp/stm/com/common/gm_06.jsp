		<h4 class="process-title">Introductions</h4>
		<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
			<li>The introduction seeks to raise the issue, not settle it. Articulate why, in the context of existing thinking on the subject, your topic matters.</li>
			<li>Don’t try to do too much. Offer only the most relevant context, the most essential parts of your road map, and (disciplinary conventions permitting) a first rather than last claim.</li>
			<li>Always introduce a working hypothesis, frame it with appropriately cited background or other context, and specify your method or angle of approach.</li>
			<li>Especially in longer papers, you can use a procedural opening to forecast the organization clearly, but don’t let it distract you from also stating your claim.</li>
			<li>Experiment with opening gambits: challenge a common view, use your second-best example to set up the issue, or exemplify the problem with a narrative opening.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 class="process-title">Conclusions</h4>
		<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
			<li>Culminate—don’t just summarize. Offer your most fully evolved and qualified statement of the thesis or your final judgment on the questions posed in the introduction.</li>
			<li>Come full circle: revisit the introductory hypothesis and context. This strategy will unify your paper and locate it within an ongoing conversation on your topic.</li>
			<li>Your conclusion should not unqualifiedly claim more than your evidence has established, but it should leave the reader with further implications or speculations to ponder a send-off.</li>
			<li>Let your conclusion gradually escort the reader out of the paper. Like the introduction, it is a social site, so try to leave the reader with a positive last impression.</li>
