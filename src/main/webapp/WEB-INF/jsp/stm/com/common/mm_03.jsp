	<p class="main-article">Writing any kind of paper is not that easy. It requires much of your time to do the research, analysis, and organizing the information and thoughts. We, at <strong class="blue">CebuEssay.com</strong>, are very much willing to help you. Thus, your precious time will be spent with your loved ones and part-time/full-time job. We can assure you that all your information will be kept confidential, and the ownership of the paper rightfully belongs to you. All our papers are free from plagiarism since we are using the reliable Plagiarismscanner.com and not just any other free softwares you can find anywhere. </p>
	<h4 class="process-title">Step One:</h4>
	<p class="main-article">If you perceive that the essay instruction is very difficult, and you doubt the quality of the paper that you will be receiving from us, then you can contact us first through our online LiveChat or email us at <a href="mailto:cebuessay.com">cebuessay@gmail.com</a> regarding the instruction of the essay.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title">Step Two:</h4>
	<p class="main-article">Register in our website for free. We need your information such as the email address, gender, telephone, and country. This is to ensure a smooth communication and to align the essay contents with your cultural background if needed.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title">Step Three:</h4>
	<p class="main-article">Click the "Order Now" button and fill out the order form. You can upload up to ten files in the order form. If the file is too heavy such as a video file, then you can upload it to Webhard.net using our guest username (tamura198) and password (1234). If your files are more than ten, then please send the other files through email. We highly appreciate if you can send us your lecture notes since the contents of the Course Subjects differ for every school or university; thus, we can pinpoint the specific topic you have gone through with the lecture.</p>
	<p class="main-article">Our Quality Assurance Administrator will review your order instructions and notify you for any discrepancies. If everything is clear, then we will confirm your order, and you will receive a confirmation email. The administrator will then assign your order to the appropriate writer who has an excellent knowledge of your topic.</p>
	<h4 class="process-title">Step Four:</h4>
	<p class="main-article">You can supervise your order through our LiveChat, email, and phone number.</p>
