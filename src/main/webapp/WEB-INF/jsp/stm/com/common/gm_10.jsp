	<h4 class="process-title blue">Telling Stories</h4>
	<p class="main-article">As we go about our lives, we need to open our ears and take note when a story comes our way. To train ourselves to notice stories, it’s helpful to practice using some common story sources. Sometimes, when we explore these sources, we find stories we like that we can simply retell. We can also gather material from story sources and put it together in different ways to create new stories. In both cases, we get practice in the activity of telling a story. </p>
	<h4 class="process-title blue">Voice</h4>
	<p class="main-article">One’s writing voice is not necessarily the same as one’s speaking voice; whether we are writing a novel or a magazine article, it is unlikely that the voice we use will sound exactly like the way we speak. Nonetheless, there is something that is uniquely “us” in those words on the page.</p>
