		<li>Find the space in a format that will allow it to work as a heuristic, a set of steps designed not just to organize but to stimulate and guide your thinking. Avoid the slot filler mentality.</li>
		<li>Look for and expect to find the common denominators among the various formats you learn to use across the curriculum. You can master—and benefit from—virtually any format if you approach it not as a set of arbitrary and rigid rules, but as a formalized guide to having ideas.</li>
		<li>Don’t make your readers wait too long before you concede or refute a view that you can assume will already have occurred to them. Otherwise, they may assume you are unaware of the competing view or afraid to bring it up.</li>
		<li>Always treat opposing views fairly. A good strategy is to concede their merits but argue that, in particular context you are addressing, your position is more important or appropriate.</li>
		<li>Use climactic order to organize your points, building to your best ones. The best ones are usually the most revealing and thought-provoking, not the most obvious or commonly agreed upon.</li>
		<li>Phrasing your thesis to include a subordinate construction—“although x appear to account for z, y accounts for it better”—will give your paper a ready-made organizational shape, along with giving you something to define your own position against.</li>
		<li>A good transition reaches backward, telling where you’ve been, as the grounds for making a subsequent move forward. Opt for similarly and by contrast, for example, which specify connections for your readers, rather than merely additive transitions such as another and also.</li>
		<li>Half a page is a healthy length for most paragraphs, long enough to launch an idea but short enough to give your reader time to rest.</li>
