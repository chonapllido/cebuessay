	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">	
		<li>Learn to recognize unsubstantiated assertions, rather than treating claims as self-evident truths. Whenever you make a claim, offer your readers the evidence that led you to it.</li>
		<li>Make details speak. Explain how evidence confirms or qualifies your claim, and offer your reasons for believing the evidence means what you say it does.</li>
		<li>Say more about less rather than less about more, allowing a carefully analyzed part of your subject to provide perspective on the whole.</li>
		<li>It is generally better to make ten points on a representative issue or example than to make the same basic point about ten related issues or examples; this axiom we call 10 on 1.</li>
		<li>Argue overtly that the evidence on which you choose to focus is representative. Be careful not to generalize on the basis of too little or unrepresentative evidence.</li>
		<li>Use your best example as a lens through which to examine other evidence. Analyze subsequent examples to test and develop your conclusions, rather than just confirming that you are right.</li>
		<li>Look for difference within similarity as a way of doing 10 on 1. Rather than repeating the same overly general claim (i.e., doing 1 on 10), use significant variation within the general pattern to better develop your claim.</li>
		<li>To find the most revealing piece or feature of the evidence, keep asking yourself, What can I say with some certainty about the evidence? If you continually rehearse the facts, you are less likely to let an early idea blind you to subsequent evidence.</li>
		<li>Whatever kind of evidence youâ€™re using, the emphasis rests on how you use what you have: on articulating what the evidence means, and carefully linking it to your claims.</li>
