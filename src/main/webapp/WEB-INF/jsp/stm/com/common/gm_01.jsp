	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
		<li>As you analyze a subject, ask not just “What are its defining parts?” but also “How do these parts help me to understand the meaning of the subject as a whole?”</li>
		<li>When you describe and summarize, attend carefully to the language you choose, since the words themselves will usually contain the germs of ideas.</li>
		<li>Always note repetitions in your subject. There is surer means of discovering what it is about.</li>
		<li>Simply listing the various strands that you find in your evidence will go a long way toward helping you discover what is most interesting and important for you to address. Then make sure to name each strand. Naming and renaming strands is itself an analytical move that will trigger further ideas.</li>
		<li>Finding binaries will help you find the questions around which a film or an essay or a speech or a poem—almost anything—is organized. Through noticing binaries and then recasting the words you use to name them, you enable yourself to discover what is at stake in whatever you are looking at or reading. To find these oppositions, ask yourself, <i>What is opposed to what?</i></li>
		<li>Always keep an eye out for anomalous details—those that seem not to fit the pattern. Anomalies help us revise our stereotypical assumptions.</li>
		<li>Don’t assume that all meanings are overt and ready-made, waiting to be found. Most of the time, they are implicit—not the same as hidden—an act of mind is required to take what is folded in and convert the suggested meanings of particular details into overt statements.</li>
		<li>Remember that regardless of the subject you select for your analysis, you should directly address not just What does this say? but also, What are we invited to make of it, and in what context?</li>
		<li>As a general rule, analysis favors live questions—where something remains to be resolved—over inert answers, places where things are already pretty much nailed down and don’t leave much space for further thinking.</li>
		<li>The process of posing and answering questions—the analytical process—is one of trial and error. Learning to write well is largely a matter of learning how to frame questions. Whatever questions you ask, the answers you propose will often produce more questions.</li>
