	<ul class="list-blue-bullets">
		<li>Look for a range of plausible interpretations rather than assuming that there will be only one right answer. Control the range of possible interpretations by attending carefully to context.</li>
		<li>Laying out the data is key to any kind of analysis, not simply because it keeps the analysis accurate but because, crucially, it is in the act of carefully describing a subject that analytical writers often have their best ideas. The words you choose to summarize your data will contain the germs of your ideas about what the subject means.</li>
		<li>All explanations and interpretations occur in a context, which functions like a lens for focusing your subject. An important part of getting an interpretation accepted as plausible is to <i>argue for the appropriateness of the interpretive context you use</i>, not just the interpretation it takes you to.</li>
		<li>It is interesting and sometimes useful to try to determine from something you are analyzing what its makers might have intended. But, by and large, you are best off concentrating on what the thing itself communicates as opposed to what someone might have wanted it to communicate. Besides, intentions can rarely be known with much accuracy.</li>
		<li>Arguing with someone else’s argument is usually as much a matter of addressing what is left unsaid—the assumptions “underneath” the argument that the arguer takes to be “givens” (obvious truths)—as confronting what gets argued overtly.</li>
		<li>A major advantage of looking for and using binaries is that they help you determine what issues are at stake in your subject; binaries position you among competing choices.</li>
		<li>Think of the binary as a starting point—a kind of deliberate overgeneralization—that allows you to set up positions you can then test in order to refine. Although framing an issue in either/or terms can be useful for stimulating a chain of thought, it is usually not a good way to end one. Let <i>either/or</i> become the <i>extent to which.</i></li>
		<li>Uncovering assumptions underneath a given position is a powerful analytical tool. To uncover assumptions, you need to read “backward”—to ask <i>what a reading must also already believe</i>, given its overt claims. In other words, you need to imagine or reinvent the process of thinking by which a writer has arrived at a position.</li>
