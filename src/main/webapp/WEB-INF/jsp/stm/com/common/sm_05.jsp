			<h2 class="article-title">Thesis</h2>
			<p>A thesis refers to “a proposition that a person advances and offers to maintain an argument. (Source: Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</p>
			<p>This definition involves three key concepts in writing a thesis: proposition, argument, and maintain. The proposition refers to the hypothesis of the researcher; his/her initial idea regarding the topic. The argument refers to the rationale of the researcher’s hypothesis. Researchers should provide the relevance of the research to capture the reader’s attention and ensure that readers will continue to read the whole study. Aside from asserting a hypothesis, researchers should provide the reason why such a hypothesis is valid and logical. As researchers state their hypothesis and defend its rationale, researchers should also maintain their argument by providing relevant information supporting their hypothesis. In this way, they can validate their hypothesis. With these descriptions, it can be said that a good thesis asserts a point of view, analyzes and answers questions arising from such point of view, and validates such answers.</p>
